    <h1>Wiesbaden Germany, My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Wiesbaden, Germany where I lived
         for a total of six years of my young life. With my father in the US Army, we moved every 3 years. I first lived there when I was 3 and then again when I was 14. The second time there is when I met my husband of 30yrs. We met at the Department of Defense High School named Gen. HH Arnold HS. That was pretty neat because that is also where Pricilla Presley went to school when she met Elvis.The city is magical to us but that aside is an incredible place to visit. It is known for it's thermal hot springs that the ancient Romans used and the bath s share still taken advantage of today. It is also the capitol of Hessen, Germany. The architecture is incredible and formed my appreciation for fine architectural craftsmanship.</p>

     <p>The image that you see above is one of the most beautiful buildings in all of Europe called the Kurhaus. Today's Wiesbaden Kurhaus was built in 1907. In addition to it's beautiful gardens, it is a spa resort and a popular place for concerts and events. It was the location of our DODs school's high school graduation every year.
