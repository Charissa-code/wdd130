            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="his-left">As a boy Bob Curtis dreamed of running free in the fresh outdoors
                after school was out. Camping and
                fishing along the banks of the roaring Evergreen River in Colorado were among his
                favorite things to
                do and then he went white water rafting. After that he was hooked. Weekend and
                summer trips would
                only curb his appetite for the wild.
            </p>
            <img class="history-img" src="images/ores.png" alt="Black and White Ores">
            <p class="his-right">In 1987 he decided to quit his accounting job and build a business
                doing what he loved the most.
                Foaming Adventures became a huge success as he brought his dream to life. Today
                Foaming Adventures
                provides chartered trips that will make you forget all about the office. With
                amazing views of Ridge
                Canyon, wildlife, and rapid trips for everyone, this is the place to come.</p>
