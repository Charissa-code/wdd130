        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Bob and Charissa Gone Crazy">
        <p> My name is Charissa Maes. I currently live in Fort Worth, TX. I have been married
            for
            over 30 years now and we have 3 adult sons, plus 1 bonus son, who live in the
            midwest with their families.
            I decided last year that I should go back to school and learn something completely
            foreign, software and web development. It is a journey that Heavenly Father is helping
            me with every step of the way.
            I am very excited to see where this journey takes me. I've already grown so much during
            this new process of learning. I have been stretched so far beyond my comfort zone, but I
            know that is where growth happens. I can't wait to look back on these days with fondness
            and gratitude for the opportunity to learn something new at this stage of my life. I
            hope I can stand as an example to the rest of my family not only of how important my
            Heavenly Father is to me but also of how important learning and growing is no matter
            what stage of life we are in.

        <p>Within the United States I live in the great state of Texas. It is the second largest
            state in the country, our state flower is the bluebonnet and in the spring time you can
            see fields of blue in the grass as they bloom a beautiful carpet of color. We have about
            367 general miles of warm Gulf of Mexico shoreline that is wonderful to swim in. I have
            really enjoyed living here in Texas.
