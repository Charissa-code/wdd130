        <h1>Charissa Maes | WDD130</h1>
        <p>My name is Charissa Maes. I currently live in Fort Worth, TX. I have been married to my high school sweetheart, Bob for over 30 years now. We have 3 sons who live in the midwest with their families, inlcluding our first grandbaby whom we adore! We have a bonus son, 2 bonus grand-daughters and one of our son's girlfriend, making our growing family pretty amazing. 
        I decided last year that I should go back to school and learn something completely foriegn, software and web development. It is a journey that Heavenly Father is helping me with every step of the way. I have included a photo of me before I went back and a photo after I went back to school. Notice the peace and or crazy in my eyes! 
        I am very excited to see where this journey takes me. I've already grown so much during this new process of learning. I have been stretched so far beyond my comfort zone, but I know that is where growth happens. I can't wait to look back on these days with fondness and gratitude for the opportunity to learn something new at this stage of my life. I hope I can stand as an example to the rest of my family not only of how important my Heavenly Father is to me but also of how important learning and growing is no matter what stage of life we are in.
